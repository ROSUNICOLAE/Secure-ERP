# ERP Software for Offline Use

We created a highly secure ERP software that works offline, with a short, clean codebase, and modular structure. Our variant of MVC architecture ensures maximum security for local data files. Dummy data was used during development. This solution offers an efficient and secure way to manage daily operations without web or cloud technologies.


This is a highly secure ERP software that operates exclusively on local files, providing a safe and efficient way to manage daily operations offline. The application has a short, clean codebase with a modular structure, separating code for different content areas and channeling all user and file I/O operations through a single channel. A variant of the MVC architecture was used for terminal and local data files to ensure maximum security.

### Installation
To run this software, you will need to have Python installed on your local machine. Additionally, you will need to manually install the tabulate module and numpy. You can install these modules using pip, as follows:

#### Copy code
* pip install tabulate 
* pip install numpy
### Usage
To run the software, simply run the main.py file in your terminal or command prompt:

#### Copy code
*   python main.py

The application will prompt you to enter your username and password to access the ERP system.

### Dummy Data
In the absence of real data from the client, we developed dummy data for the development process. The application is designed to handle a range of business operations, including sales, inventory management, and financial reporting.
